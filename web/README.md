# Web client

The page at <https://switch.gblink.io>. It installs the firmware on both boards, stores
the Switch keys on the ESP32, and then either carries the link between the boards, trades
with the Switch by itself, or sends it Mystery Gifts. It is a plain static site with no
build step and no server.

## Modes

Pick one at the top of the page, or open `#gba`, `#switch`, `#celio` or `#gift` directly.

**GBA to Switch** (ESP32 board + GB-Link adapter)

1. **ESP32 board:** install the firmware and drop your `prod.keys` on the page.
2. **GB-Link adapter:** install the wireless adapter firmware.
3. **Play:** wire the boards together, or leave both on USB and let the page pass the
   traffic between them. For Ruby and Sapphire, pick them here: the page links the game
   by cable (the adapter's mode `0x01`) and translates that link into the Switch's
   wireless, so both boards must be on USB. For Emerald and Ruby/Sapphire the page's
   National Dex bypass, when turned on, lets trades go ahead whatever either game's
   progress.

**PC to Switch** (ESP32 board only)

1. **ESP32 board:** the same as above.
2. **Trade:** *Wonder Trade* with the pool at <https://pokemon.gblink.io>, or *PK3
   files* from a party kept in your browser. `assets/party.json` is the party a first
   visit starts with.

The page never offers a Pokémon on its own. The Switch never tells the other side what
its player picked, so the page waits for you to choose or press *Accept trade*.

**Mystery Gift** (ESP32 board only)

1. **ESP32 board:** the same as above, with firmware 2.1.0 or later.
2. **Mystery Gift:** pick a Wonder Card, or drop a `.wc3` file of your own on the card,
   and press *Start*. The page leads a group as a FireRed sharing a card; on the Switch,
   MYSTERY GIFT, WONDER CARDS, FRIEND, then GBLINK. The card for the next Switch can
   change while the group is open.

A Switch that already has the card is sent it again only if you say so on the page. The
group stays open for one Switch after another; after a link the page had to end itself,
the board restarts and the group opens again.

Keep the tab visible while playing. Browsers slow down hidden tabs, and the game drops a
partner that stops answering.

The keys stay on your computer and the board. The page reads the four values it needs
from `prod.keys`, sends them to the board over USB, and does not keep or upload them.
The board never sends them back.

## Running it locally

USB access only works over `https://` or from `localhost`:

```
python3 -m http.server -d web 8000
```

Then open <http://localhost:8000> in Chrome or Edge on a computer.

| Browser | ESP32 board | GB-Link adapter |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Chrome, Edge (desktop) | yes | yes |
| Firefox 151 and later | yes | serial only; install its firmware by hand |
| Safari, phones | no | no |

On Linux:

- Add yourself to the serial group (`dialout`, or `uucp` on Arch).
- The adapter needs udev rules for WebUSB. Run `scripts/setup-linux-permissions.sh`
  from the GB-Link firmware repository.
- If Chrome says the port was lost right after you used `esptool.py` or `idf.py`,
  unplug the board and plug it back in.

## Firmware images

`firmware/` holds the images the page installs, listed in `firmware/manifest.json`.
Refresh them after a build with:

```
firmware/tools/package_web.py
```

## Code

| File | |
| --- | --- |
| `js/app.js` | the page |
| `js/esp.js`, `js/wire.js` | talking to the ESP32 firmware |
| `js/gblink.js` | talking to the GB-Link adapter |
| `js/bridge.js` | passing traffic between the two boards |
| `js/flash-esp.js`, `js/flash-pico.js` | installing firmware |
| `js/keys.js` | reading `prod.keys` |
| `js/trade/` | trading without a GBA |
| `js/cable/` | Ruby and Sapphire: the adapter's cable mode and the translation to the Switch's wireless (`translator.js` is MPL-2.0, ported from [mgba_LDN](https://github.com/Gr3nSkyDragon/mgba_LDN)) |
| `js/gift/` | Mystery Gift: the group the Switch joins as a friend, the gift exchange (from [gblink-wondercards](https://github.com/GB-Link/gblink-wondercards)) and the cards; `team.js` is written by `cards/build.mjs`, `wc3.js` reads `.wc3` files |

## Tests

These run without any hardware:

```
node web/tests/run.mjs            # framing and the board connection
node web/tests/trade.mjs          # trade code against the C# host
node web/tests/session-test.mjs   # whole trades against a stand-in Switch
node web/tests/cable-test.mjs     # Ruby's cable link translated, against stand-ins for both games
node web/tests/gift-test.mjs      # the cards, and whole deliveries to a stand-in Switch's Mystery Gift
```
